How to Make the Cake:

    1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F and prepare three 8-inch cake pans with non-stick baking spray and parchment paper in the bottom.

    2. Add the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt to a large mixer bowl and combine them. Then, set the bowl aside.

    3. Add the milk, vegetable oil, vanilla extract, and eggs to a medium sized bowl and combine them.

    4. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and beat until well combined.

    5. Add the hot water to the batter slowly and mix on low speed until well combined. (Even scrape down the sides of the bowl if the batter gets stuck on them so then everything can be combined properly.)

    6. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans and bake for 22-25 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out with a few moise crumbs.

    7. Remove cakes from the oven and let them cool.



How to Make the Chocolate Mousse:

    1. Stir the cocoa powder and the hot water together.

    2. Melt the chocolate chips until they are smooth. You can melt them in a double-boiler or in the microwave.

    3. Add the cocoa mixture to the melted choclate chips and stir them well to combine them. Allow the mixture to cool to room temperature.

    4. In a large separate bowl, beat the cream and sugar until very stiff peaks forms. Add the chocolate mixture and fold in with a spatula until well combined.

    5. Refrigerate until ready to use.



How to Make the Dark Chocolate Ganache:

    1. Heat the heavy cream and the butter in a 3-quart saucepan over a medium high heat. Heat it until it starts to boil.

    2. Place the semisweet chocolate in a 3-quart stainless steel bowl.

    3. Pour the boiling cream over the chocolate and allow it to stand for 5 minutes. Stir until smooth.

    4. Chill 1 cup of the ganache for at least 1 hour. The remaining ganache should be at room temperature.



Building the Cake:

    1. Level the tops of the cakes by using a large serrated knife.

    2. The cake can be built in an 8x3 inch cake pan, a springform pan, or with a clear cake collar. 

        If Using Cake Pan:
            Put a cardboard cake circle in the bottom of the pan.

        If Using Springform Pan:
            Put plastic wrap on the bottom of the pan and up the sides so you can lift the cake out when you are done. The sides of the cake should be lined with parchment paper, which should be stuck up above the top edge of the pan.

        If Using Clear Cake Collar:
            Place the bottom cake on a cardboard cake circle OR place it on a serving plate and wrap the cake collar around it and secure it in place.

    3. Add half of the chocolate mousse and spread it on the top of the first layer of the cake evenly.

    4. Add the second layer of cake on top of the mousse, and then add the rest of the mousse on top of that layer the same way you did the first time.
    
    5. Add the final cake layer. Refrigerate the cake until the mousse is firm, which will take 2-4 hours.



Finshing the Cake:

    1. Take out the cake and the ganache from the fridge.

    2. Put the ganache into a pastry bag fitted with a star tip. Remove the cake by removing the springform pan sides, lifting the cake out of the pan with the plastic wrap, or removing the cake collar. It depends on what you were using.

    3. Coat the sides and top of the cake with the room temperature ganache. With the chill ganache, you can decorate the cake by adding any designs you want. You can also add things like sprinkles, chopped nuts, cookie crumbs, etc.
